ndb - Nerdiest Door Bell

originally written because while i had a CHiMP mirror, i could never tell when someone came into my office. attached a camera to a linux box, installed some libraries and this is the result.

prereqs:
#  take_picture.py - python script to take a picture from webcam
#  python-opencv   - python package to interface with camera .. ubuntu can sudo apt-get install this
#  libgd2-xpm-dev  - image libraries for GD .. ubuntu can sudo apt-get install this too
#  libssl-dev      - SSL binaries .. ubuntu can sudo apt-get install
#  Crypt::SSLeay   - SSL crypto package from CPAN
#  IO::Socket:SSL  - SSL wrapper
#  XML::Stream     - XMPP dependency

configuration:
currently internal to nerdiestdoorbell.pl, in the hash '%s' (future versions will externalize this into an XML file). the XMPP settings are preconfigured to use a Google Talk XMPP connection, but this can easily be changed (x_* variables). the motion settings are tuned to a darkish room (where camera is) looking out to a well lit hallway, so will need to be modified to suit your environment.
